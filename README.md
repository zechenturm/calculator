# calculator
Toy Command Line Calculator to learn about compilers written in Java.

This is a toy implementation of a command line calculator to understand the basics of building my own scripting language.

Currently, it only handles integers and the four basic operations +,-.*,/ as well as parentheses.

Planned features:

- [x] basic operations
- [x] operator precedence
- [x] parentheses
- [x] multiline programs
- [x] variable declarations
- [x] if-else expression
- [x] builtin functions
- [x] byte code compiler
- [x] VM to run byte code
- [ ] CFG generation
- [ ] SSA implementation
- [ ] SSA optimizations
